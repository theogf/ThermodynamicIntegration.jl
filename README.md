A simple package to compute Thermodynamic Integration for computing the evidence in a Bayesian setting.
You need to provide the `logprior` and the `loglikelihood` as well as an initial sample:
```julia
    using Distributions, ThermodynamicIntegration
    D = 5
    prior = MvNormal(0.5 * ones(D))
    likelihood = MvNormal(2.0 * ones(D))
    logprior(x) = logpdf(prior, x)
    loglikelihood(x) = logpdf(likelihood, x)

    alg = ThermInt(n_samples=5000)

    logZ = alg(logprior, loglikelihood, rand(prior)) # Compute the log evidence
    # -8.244829688529377
    true_logZ = -0.5 * (logdet(cov(prior) + cov(likelihood)) + D * log(2Ï€)) # we compare twith the true value
    # -8.211990123364176
```

You can also simply pass a Turing model :
```julia
    using Turing
    @model function gauss(y)
        x ~ prior
        y ~ MvNormal(x, cov(likelihood))
    end

    alg = ThermInt(n_samples=5000)
    model = gauss(zeros(D))
    turing_logZ = alg(model)
    # # -8.211990123364176
```

Right now sampling is based on [`AdvancedHMC.jl`](https://github.com/TuringLang/AdvancedHMC.jl), with the `ForwardDiff` AD backend.
To change the backend to `Zygote` or `ReverseDiff` (recommended for variables with large dimensions you can do:
```julia
    using Zygote # (or ReverseDiff)
    ThermoDynamicIntegration.set_adbackend(:Zygote) # (or :ReverseDiff)
```
